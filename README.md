The Capstone project for IBM's data science professional cerificate

In the age of commercial space travelling, SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
The aim of this data science project is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
